In this simulation, Steve will traverse a mildly griefed superflat world in search of a cow to eat.
The path (outlined in purple) is generated every time the cow moves
The cow will move when a collision is detected between it and steve
The cow moves randomly, each new position being randomly generated as needed
Steve will follow the path via LERP over all of the path's points
I could not get the path to generate the shortest possible path every time with the time I had due to some personal issues that arose, 
but it does always generate a path, so long as there are no obstacles/holes in the way
